| id             | int      |

id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row contains information about the name of a movie, its genre, and its rating.
rating is a 2 decimal places float in the range [0, 10]
 

Write a solution to report the movies with an odd-numbered ID and a description that is not "boring".

Return the result table ordered by rating in descending order.
Explanation: 
We have three movies with odd-numbered IDs: 1, 3, and 5. The movie with ID = 3 is boring so we do not include it in the answer.


Solution:
SELECT *
FROM cinema 
WHERE (id % 2 = 1) AND (description != "boring") ORDER BY rating DESC;
